# Star Wars for Teams

## Inroduction

Microsoft Teams doesn't allow the upload of GIF images as virtual backgrounds by default. But by changing the file extension into .png and copying it (along with a duplicate named ..._thumb.png) manually into the folder, where teams stores custom backgrounds, it is possible anyhow. See https://return2.net/microsoft-teams-add-animated-background-image-gif/ for detailed instructions.
By combining this trick with some tweaks on the custom camera settings tinting the image blue, you can achieve a pretty neat hologram effect.
